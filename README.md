# Shopify Backend Intern Challenge

`imgify` was created for the Fall 2021 Shopify Backend Intern Challenge.


`imgify` allows users to view and submit images. Each image submission can have one or more images (albums).
Users who are logged in can view their submissions and edit or delete them as they choose.

## Usage

The `client` and `server` folders are each their own node project.
Simply use `npm start` in each folder to start the corresponding front or back-end of the application.
