# Shopify Backend Intern Challenge

*imgify* was created for the Fall 2021 Shopify Backend Intern Challenge.


*imgify* allows users to view and submit images. Each image submission can have one or more images (albums).
Users who are logged in can view their submissions and modify them as they choose.

## Usage

The `client` and `server` folders are each their own node project for the front and back-end respectively.
Simply use `npm start` in each folder to start the corresponding project.
`.env` development templates are provided, simply copy them as-is or modify them to your discretion.
